## Features Implemented

### Must-Have Features (100% Covered)
-   **âœ… Source Selector:** Users can select from a list of previously uploaded PDFs.
-   **âœ… PDF Uploader:** A drag-and-drop interface allows users to upload their own PDF coursebooks.
-   **âœ… PDF Viewer:** An embedded viewer displays the content of the selected PDF alongside the quiz area.
-   **âœ… Quiz Generator Engine:**
    -   Generates Multiple Choice, Short Answer, and Long Answer questions directly from the PDF content using the Gemini API.
    -   Renders the quiz in a clean, user-friendly format.
    -   Captures and submits user answers.
    -   Scores submissions and stores attempts in a MongoDB database.
    -   Provides AI-generated feedback and explanations for each question.
-   **âœ… Progress Tracking:**
    -   A dedicated "Progress" tab shows a history of all quiz attempts.
    -   Displays key metrics like total attempts and average score.

### UI/UX & Responsiveness
-   **ðŸŽ¨ Modern UI/UX:** The interface is inspired by modern web applications like ChatGPT, with a clean sidebar/main content layout.
-   **ðŸ“± Fully Responsive:** The layout seamlessly adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
-   **ðŸŒ“ Light/Dark Mode:** Includes a theme toggler for user preference.
-   **ðŸ’¬ User Feedback:** Incorporates loading spinners, progress bars, and toast notifications to keep the user informed.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

This project uses a classic and robust client-server architecture.

-   **Backend:** **Flask (Python)**
    -   A lightweight and powerful framework for building the REST API.
-   **Database:** **MongoDB**
    -   A flexible NoSQL database, perfect for storing PDF metadata and quiz attempts. `PyMongo` is used as the driver.
-   **Frontend:** **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**
    -   This choice was made deliberately to showcase strong foundational skills in core web technologies without relying on a framework. It demonstrates proficiency in DOM manipulation, asynchronous API calls (`fetch`), and state management from first principles.
-   **AI Integration:** **Google Gemini API**
    -   Used for the core logic of parsing PDF text to generate questions and for scoring user-submitted answers with detailed feedback.
-   **PDF Processing:** **PyPDF2**
    -   A Python library used on the backend to extract text content from uploaded PDF files.

## How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
-   Python 3.x
-   MongoDB Atlas account (or a local MongoDB instance)
-   Google Gemini API Key

### Setup Instructions
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repo-url]
    cd [repo-name]
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install Flask pymongo python-dotenv PyPDF2 google-generativeai
    ```

3.  **Create the environment file:**
    -   Create a file named `.env` in the root directory.
    -   Add your credentials to this file:
        ```
        MONGO_URI="your_mongodb_connection_string"
        GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key"
        ```

4.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

5.  **Open the application:**
    -   Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your web browser.

## Project Decisions & Tradeoffs

-   **Vanilla JS vs. a Framework:** I chose to use vanilla JavaScript to demonstrate strong foundational web development skills. While a framework like React could offer more complex state management, the chosen approach was faster to implement for this scope and proves a deeper understanding of the underlying browser APIs.
-   **Gemini API for Scoring:** Instead of simple string matching, I used a second call to the Gemini API for scoring. This provides more nuanced, intelligent feedback, which is a significant value-add for a learning tool, even if it introduces a slight delay.
-   **No User Authentication:** To focus on the core features required by the assignment within the given timeframe, a user authentication system was intentionally omitted. All data is currently public.

## LLM Usage

Large Language Models (Google Gemini) were used extensively and aggressively to meet the project's tight deadline, as encouraged by the assignment.

-   **Code Generation:** The Gemini API was prompted to generate boilerplate code for the Flask backend, including API endpoint structures and database connection logic.
-   **Frontend Logic:** It assisted in writing complex JavaScript functions for DOM manipulation, asynchronous API calls, and dynamic HTML rendering.
-   **UI/UX Ideas:** The overall UI design was refined based on suggestions and CSS code generated by the LLM.
-   **Debugging:** The LLM was used as a debugging partner to identify issues in both Python and JavaScript code, significantly speeding up the development process.
